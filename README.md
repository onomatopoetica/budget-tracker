## About The Project

The scope of this project was to create a progressive web application (PWA) which provides users a simple way to manage finances while planning for a vacation. This application is to be functional regardless of whether they have internet connectivity.

Users are able to add deposits and expenses to the budget in a clean and simple interface which renders across a variety of devices online or offline. Users can choose to install the app onto their device _see [Demo](#Demo) below_ which then places an icon on their device.

Functionality of the application includes:

* Offline functionality
    * Enter deposits and expenses offline
* Once online, offline entries are added to the budget tracker 

Because this application cannot be deployed on GitHub, a walkthrough video demonstrates its functionality below. The deployed app can be found on [Heroku](https://agile-river-83351.herokuapp.com/).
